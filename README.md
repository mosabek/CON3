# Streamlit App for Detecting excavators in images 

This app allows you to upload an image of excavators and use an [object detection model](https://models.roboflow.com/object-detection) to detect excavators genearally .

If you want to build your own model, you'll need your own API key. [Create a Roboflow account](https://app.roboflow.com) to get your own API key.

Want to [build and deploy your own object detection model and app](https://blog.streamlit.io/how-to-use-roboflow-and-streamlit-to-visualize-object-detection-output/)? Follow the steps in our "How To" blog!

This app was created using [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com) and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).
